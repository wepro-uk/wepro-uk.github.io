## Introduction to ONE XIAMEN BAY

ONE XIAMEN BAY is a collaborative work of Gemdale, a powerful central enterprise of China Resources, and Xiamen's local state-owned enterprise, Guomao Real Estate. The three real estate brands have joined forces to create an "experience work in the bay area".

In the community planning, the "axial symmetry" layout adopted by ONE XIAMEN BAY greatly improves the ventilation and convection of the community.

Through the scientific and reasonable distribution of buildings, the maximum building distance of ONE XIAMEN BAY can reach about 90.1 meters, which ensures the indoor space's daylighting and ventilation while further enhancing the privacy of the owners' lives.

In the selection of building facade materials, ONE XIAMEN BAY uses "LOW-E insulating glass", which is extremely rare in Xiamen's residential products. As a rare public-building-level facade in Xiamen's residential products, it greatly improves the aesthetics while having unparalleled powerful functions, reducing direct UV radiation by about 25% and reducing noise by 35-40 decibels.

ONE XIAMEN BAY has a landscape area of 70%, and the garden is divided into "8 functional areas", including the lounge, children's playground, and elder activity center, allowing family members to have fun.

ONE XIAMEN BAY has an excellent surrounding environment. Just across the road is the "South Bank Central Axis Park" and the "South Bank Waterfront Park". It is only 500 meters away from the 200,000-square-meter ring bay belt park, Maluan Bay Wetland Park/New Moon Park. Surrounded by three large parks, it is within easy reach.

It has a 500,000-square-meter large commercial complex "China Merchants Garden City", which is the fourth super-large subway-overground complex in Xiamen after the Island's Baolong Yicheng,华润 Vientiane City, and Xiang'an Times Upper City. Within 1KM, there is also the Maluan Bay Life Plaza and Yonghui Supermarket for one-stop living facilities.

"Changhai Hospital" is only 200 meters away from ONE XIAMEN BAY. It has been put into use and is a civilian, high-level tertiary general hospital that integrates medical care, health care, retirement, and research. 3km away is the "Fudan University Affiliated Tumor Hospital", which is built to the highest standards of national grade-A tertiary hospitals and is currently the only grade-A tertiary hospital in Haicang.

The location of ONE XIAMEN BAY is the last U-shaped bay in Xiamen after Yundang Lake and Wuyuan Bay, and it is also a rare area where "3 metros" intersect; it is only 500 meters away from the Xinyang Avenue Station/New An Station of Metro Line 2.

## Introduction to Maluan Bay New Town

As a key development area of Xiamen's "Double Hundred Billion Project", the planning of Maluan Bay New Town has been finalized. Positioned as the "sub-center of Xiamen City" and a strategic support point of the "Belt and Road Initiative", Maluan Bay New Town. After four years of development and construction, it has completed a fixed investment of 69.5 billion yuan, and the new territory of land and water with "one bay, two islands, three areas, and multiple points" has begun to take shape. The "five horizontal and six vertical" backbone road network has basically taken shape. With the completion and operation of a large number of commercial/educational/medical/eco-compatible supporting key public buildings, the value of this billion-dollar bay area new town is gradually being realized.
